# Batch-Size

The batch size is a hyperparameter that defines the number of samples to work through before
updating the internal model parameters. In the context of training machine learning models,
particularly neural networks, data is often divided into batches for computational efficiency and
practicality. The choice of batch size can significantly affect the performance of the model in terms of
speed, convergence, and accuracy. Here's a detailed look at the implications and considerations
associated with batch size:
